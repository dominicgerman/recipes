## Instructions

1. Add all of the sauce ingredients to a medium bowl and whisk well. Set aside.
2. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once it's hot, add the ground pork and cook until no pink remains. To make it crispy, stir occasionally to allow the pork to sit in the hot oil before stirring. This crisps the outsides to a golden brown color.
3. When the pork is done, add the water chestnuts, red pepper, carrots and onion and cook until soft, 5-7 minutes.
4. Stir in the sauce until it's completely combined then turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer for 8-10 minutes to thicken and develop the flavor.
5. Remove the pan from the heat then serve inside the lettuce cups. You may need to double up the lettuce cups for a sturdier wrap. Top with chopped scallions, cilantro and peanuts if desired.
6. If you're making the sauce, whisk all of the ingredients together in a small bowl while the pork filling simmers. Top the lettuce wraps with sauce before serving.
